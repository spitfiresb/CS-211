# Anagrams

Anagrams is a student project for use in CS 1 / CS 2 courses 
including CS 211 at University of Oregon.  It is inspired by 
the [anagrams project](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2006/reges-anagrams/)
contributed to the 
[Stanford Nifty Projects collection](http://nifty.stanford.edu/) by 
Stuart Reges, although the implementation and instructions were 
independently developed at University of Oregon my Michal Young. 

## Learning objectives

- Exercise in creation of a collection class (a bag of letters) 
  designed to be useful for a particular algorithm. 
- Recursive solution of an enumeration problem. 
- Aliasing issues and their resolution by copying mutable data 
  structures. 

Detailed instructions for completion are in
[docs/HOWTO-anagram.md](docs/HOWTO-anagram.md).
